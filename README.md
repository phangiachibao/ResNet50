# ResNet50
Residual Network 50
This is a Neural Network with 50 layers.
=> First: Create a folder and name it "dataset", then add your data into this folder
(Note: your data much follow this structure: data_name --> folders (named classes) --> each classes have images)
=> Second: Run **split_data_into_train_test_set.py** to split your data into train test set folders.
=> 3rd: Run **training.py** to train model (you can set *epochs* or *batch_size* to improve your model)
=> 4th: Run **predict.py** to see a predict your picture (you can choose test_set or your image to predict)
